# Data Structure Notes

### 1. Coding or Software Engineering?
- It's nothing but manipulating data to perform or define some opeartions/actions
- Example: If we are developing an API, then it is helpful for retrieving and adding data in some database for a client that asks for.
- And where data structure comes into play, manipluating the data involves structuring, organizing and managing the data.

### 2. What is a Data Structure?
- A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

### 3. Why Ds? Why it is important?
- They are essential ingredients in creating the fast and powerful algorithms.
- They make code cleaner and easirer to understand.

### 4. What is Abstract data type?
- Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behaviour is defined by a set of value and a set of operations.
- The definition of ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented. It does not specify how data will be organized in
memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations. It is called “abstract” because it gives an implementation-independent view. The process of providing only the essentials and hiding the details is known as abstraction.
