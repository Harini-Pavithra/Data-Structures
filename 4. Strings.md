### Strings
- It is one of the data types 
- It has Time and Space complexities
- Strings are stored in the memory as array of integers
- It uses some coding standards to convert strings to integers
- Most used coding standard technique is ASCII standards(A-65,B-66,a-97)
- Other coding standards takes more bytes of memory
- Every character in string will be stored as fixed number of bytes in the memory
- Example: "this is a string"
- Time complexity of Traversing a string is O(N) and space complexity is O(1)
- Time complexity of Copying a string is O(N) and space complexity is O(N)
- Time complexity of getting a character from string is O(1) and space complexity is O(1)
- strings are immutable
- Example "foobar" += "x" takes O(N) operations ( the string has to be copied first then the character x should be added)
- Example 2: "foobar" += "abc" + "def" then it takes O(N+M) operations(the string has to be copied then depends upon the length of 2 strings the operations are performed)
- Converting a string to array helps to mutate the string in constant time operations which takes O(N) operations
