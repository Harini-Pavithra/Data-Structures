# Memory 

![Memory](https://github.com/Harini-Pavithra/Data-Structures/blob/main/Images/Memory.PNG)

- Memory is the storage space in the computer, where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored.
- Bounded slots: A finite number of memory slots and only limited amount of data can be stored.

### Functions
- The program stores variable in empty slots.
- If the program need to store in more than one memory block then it will store it in a back to back memory slot.
- Any dta is converted into binary numbers by base2 format or binary number format(0s & 1s) and store it as 8 bits pr 1 byte in memory slots.
- Example: if a integer has to be stored in one of the memory slots then the following calculation will be done.
   - An integer value = 32 bits
   - so, (32/8) = 4 and 4 bytes of back to back memory is needed to store an integer value.

- In the above image, we can see that the integer value 1(0000 0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000) is stored in the memory slots 4 to 7 in 32bits format. But why the value 0000 0001
is stored in 4th slot instead of 7th slot, and this brings us to the concept called "Endianness"

### What is Endianness?
- Different languages read their text in different orders. English reads from left to right, for example, while Arabic is read right to left.
- This is exactly what endianness is for computers.
- If my computer reads bytes from left to right, and your computer reads from right to left, we're going to have issues when we need to communicate.
- Endianness means that the bytes in computer memory are read in a certain order.
- Endianness is represented two ways Big-endian (BE) and Little-endian (LE).
  - BE stores the big-end first. When reading multiple bytes the first byte (or the lowest memory address) is the biggest - so it makes the most sense to people who read left to right.
  - LE stores the little-end first. When reading multiple bytes the first byte (or the lowest memory address) is the littlest -  so it makes most sense to people who read right to left.

### Storing List in Memory

![List](https://github.com/Harini-Pavithra/Data-Structures/blob/main/Images/List.PNG)

- The list is one of the most widely used data types in Python. Lists are used to store the data items where each data item is separated by a comma.
- In the above example, we are storing 2 integer values i.e [1,2], as we already know an integer value takes 32bits. So, 2 integrer value takes 64 bits 
- For storing 64bits of data we need 8 free back to back memory slots.
- Integer 1 is stored from 4th slot to 7th slot and integer 2 is stored from 8 to 11 memory slots.

### Storing Pointers in Memory
- The pointer is a variable which stores the address of another variable.
- The address is converted into binary numbers using base2 format or Binary number format.
- Computers can access all the memory slots directly and very quickly given the memory address.

### Storing Strings in Memory
- The characters are mapped to their respective ASCII numbers first.
- Example: The ASCII value for 'A' is 65, 'B' is 66 and so on
- Then the mapped ASCII numbers are converted into bunch of bits and stored in the memory.
