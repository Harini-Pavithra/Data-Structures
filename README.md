# Data Structures
Data Structures are necessary for designing efficient algorithms. It provides reusability and abstraction . Using appropriate data structure, can help programmers save a good amount of time while performing operations such as storage, retrieval or processing of data. This Repository consist of all the notes for important data structure concepts.
